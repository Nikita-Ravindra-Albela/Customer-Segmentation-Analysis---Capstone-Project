📊 Customer Segmentation Analysis – Capstone Project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Project Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was completed as part of my MBA in HR & Business Analytics. It focuses on Customer Segmentation Analysis, a powerful technique to understand customer behavior, identify high-value groups, and enable data-driven business strategies.

Using Power BI and DAX, I built an interactive dashboard that delivers actionable insights to support customer retention, targeted marketing, and revenue growth.

🎯 Objectives
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The key goals of this project were:

To segment customers based on their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores.

To analyze revenue contribution across different customer segments.

To study payment method preferences for customer convenience and operational improvements.

To apply Pareto Analysis to highlight how a small proportion of customers drive the majority of revenue.

To create a Power BI dashboard that translates data into easy-to-understand, strategic insights.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Power BI: Dashboard development and visualization

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Calculated measures and columns for RFM scoring & KPIs

RFM Analysis: Recency, Frequency, Monetary scoring model

Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule): Revenue distribution analysis

SQL/Excel (if applicable): Data preparation and cleaning

📈 Key Insights
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RFM Segmentation: Customers were grouped into actionable segments like Loyal Customers, At Risk, Recent Customers, and Lost Customers.

Revenue Segmentation: A small proportion of customers contributed disproportionately to revenue.

Payment Analysis: Highlighted preferences in payment methods, providing insights into customer convenience and operational strategy.

Pareto Analysis: Confirmed that ~20% of customers drive ~80% of revenue.

🚀 Business Impact
